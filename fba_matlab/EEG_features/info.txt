% For the following variables in the workspace once loaded relate to:
% 'D1_18ch_EEG_Features_Age.mat' = training dataset, features derived on average of 18 channel 
% 'D1_2ch_EEG_Features_Age.mat' = training dataset, features derived on average of 2 channel 
% 'D2_2ch_EEG_Features_Age.mat' = external dataset, features derived on average of 2 channel
%
% age_bins = the ages in which the cell 'ages_binned' correspond to 
%
% all subject ages can be accessed via:
% 	subject_age = horzcat(ages_binned{:});

% EEG features represent z-scored values for each features on 'feature_list'
